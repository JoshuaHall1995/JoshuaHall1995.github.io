Younger Josh, in life there will be many times you sublimely join in on trends without actually knowing what they mean. Think KONY 2012 or guacamole, after a while you will fake understanding long enough until people start to think you know what you are doing.

We both know better.

This will not be an issue in only your personal bubble. One day as your code expands you will start to see a new word suggested by intelisense as you type. Sometimes you will use it, sometimes you won’t. Async shall spread throughout your codebase, sometimes awaited and sometimes not. 

People will ask if you understand what it does and you shall nod, the idiots fooled by your confident mannerisms until eventually you are caught, embarrassed and actually learn. 

With the power of perspective I implore you to avoid ignorance younger Josh. It isn’t actually that complicated.

<h2>What is it? (Stolen)</h2>
“With asynchronous programming, you can divide your logic into awaitable tasks, where you can perform some long running operations such as reading large file, doing an API call, downloading a resource from web or performing a complex calculation without having to block the execution of your application on UI or service.”

<h2>What is it? (In a way younger Josh will understand)</h2>

Imagine you are in a kitchen, Josh. Someone has trusted you with making a bacon and sausage sandwich. In a simple scenario it is only a few steps:

Butter bread, cook bacon, cook sausage, add ketchup. 

Nice and easy. You can do this. If you do the steps in order it can be done in about 8 minutes with only a 25% chance of food poisoning.

In a one off case this is not too much of an issue. But if I ask you to do this 100 times suddenly the one step after another could be a bit of a blocker. 

But if you approach the sandwich asynchronously there is no reason once you have buttered the bread you can’t proceed with the following two tasks at the same time. This would mean I don’t need to wait to cook my sausage after my bacon and probably don’t have a sandwich of multiple heat levels.  

Of course I cannot put ketchup on my food until I have the meat prepared so I need to know to expect the bacon and sausage before I carry on.

Sandwich is prepared faster but the key dependencies remain fulfilled. 

<h2>Rambles</h2>

Silly example for a useful concept although it should not be considered a solution for all problems. Async calls are perfect for a situation you are writing to a location frequently but can be problematic when experiencing a high level of demand for reads.

Because you are trusting others places to complete tasks at their own pace you can encounter a scenario where your data point has eventual consistency (a phrase younger Josh should not concern himself with as it still hurts older him). 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In the years to come you will fall into async programming like you fell into avocado on toast and gin and tonic. 

It is a simple concept but it is not a solution for all problems. Like everything you should look for context of what issue you are trying to solve before blinding writing a fix and praying the pull request is approved. 

Forgotten awaits will break dozens of your tests and the .Result you add on occasion shall make peers groan but eventually it will all make a lot more sense.
