title: FaceApi - I Never Touched The Owl

I do stupid things. Sometimes by accident, like smacking a golfball back to someone when theirs landed near me, or on purpose by turning nicely organized cardboard boxes into my own personal crash pad.

(The boxes were reassembled. I am not a complete animal)

With that in mind I started to think of protecting my already damaged reputation, after all changing my ways requires will power. So, I imagined a scenario: 

“I am caught in a picture on a Thursday morning, 8am in a neighbors garden punching an owl who looked at me funny wearing a spider-women shirt”.

Owls are 64% of peoples favorite wing-based creatures (don’t fact check) and SpiderWoman attacks the idea that only men can be bitten by spiders. My career is ruined! Unless… 

<h6>Image Blurring</h6>

Okay, this will not help with the reverse image search. Or with the video footage. But still it is an interesting concept. As facial recognition API’s become more readily available the options for recognizing and blocking faces from images becomes more readily available. 

If Facebook can identify a face to tag me against from a random night back in 2014 then another service can be brought in to remove me from a scenario. 

This is especially powerful in cases where although pictures are taken you are not allowed to show the faces of other people. Think of news reports with one out of six blurred, or a Childs records with images of progress. People do not like it when images of children are shared without permission.  

In the test project I am doing here the identification of a specific person is not required, but it is worth considering. If you have a service that can return estimated age, gender and more given the necessary setup and parameters it can identify you in a crowd. For now, let’s just go simple, given a face find it and block it. 

Imagine everyone is guilty and wants their dignity preserved. And everyone wants to mess with FaceAPI. 

<h6>Setup</h6>
To get access is easy from Azure. Add a resource then select the region, name, subscription and soul for Api to suck from and you should quickly be presented with an ApiKey and URL to ping with your facial recognition needs.  

From there you can commit it to version control on a public GitRepo or start implementing (hard to guess what I almost did). 

<h6>What Is It</h6>
I first encountered the use of FaceApi at CraftConference in Budapest in 2019 as I sought out the free beer. It told me I was a woman in my mid-thirties. I managed to overcome the years it added to me thanks to the use of mini-car (the finest form of car transportation).

Like anything machine learning based it will only grow more accurate the more it is implemented. Or at least that is what I told myself when I was five years younger, Albert still female, a hour later. 

According to Microsoft FaceApi it allows you to: “Embed facial recognition into your apps for a seamless and highly secured user experience. No machine learning expertise is required. Features include: face detection that perceives faces and attributes in an image; person identification that matches an individual in your private repository of up to 1 million people; perceived emotion recognition that detects a range of facial expressions such as happiness, contempt, neutrality and fear; and recognition and grouping of similar faces in images.” 

In my eyes, yes it can identify you beating up an owl. 

<h6>Imaginary EntryPoint</h6>
To use it I needed my setup. My beautiful entry point to receive an image, ping it sat my Api and see my face go from revealed to hidden.  

I can’t lie to you. I cheated. I am still learning about Image Processing and data storage techniques.  

So I opted for skipping the actual Http called entry point of a real entry point and instead just created the handler, which from my test class and local settings I could configure to take in a <a href="https://joshuahall1995.github.io/technologyTinder/2020-5-29-blob-storage">Blob Storage Account</a>(to store my images before and after I blur them) and my FaceApi implementation (basically my to identify and blur faces). 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ImageBlurHandler.png" alt="Image Blur" 
    style="width: 400px; 
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;"/>

From learning of ImageProcessing and storage it become clear most people don’t mess with images. No no no. They instead work with Uri to a saved image somewhere else or the image as a stream of data.  

I combined the ideas and imaged as the request to blur came down my flow the image would have already been uploaded to the BlobStorage and the file ImageCollectionId (what is associated to the image) and the image name passed on to me.  

Totally didn’t just do this to make my BlobStorage layer simpler. What this meant was I just needed to grab the image, pass it to my FaceApi then update my blob storage. 

My imaginary system with imaginary entry point was totally designed for an eventually consistent image collection so this was all good.  

<h6>Face to Face</h6>
In a nutshell, the Microsoft FaceApi works like a bad drive through, you turn up and shout what you want, and it throws it all back at you. And the stuff you didn’t ask for.  

With the address of the image once I had read it as a stream into my Image object off to the FaceApi it went. Nice and lazy, so lazy the same memory stream I read my image from is just rewound and passed to the FaceApi to return a list of ”FaceRectangles” telling me where on the image the faces are to block.

    style="width: 400px;

    margin-right: auto;"/>

(Bonus: RecognitionModel.Recognition01 is used for detecting faces in clear images. Not for partial views. This is designed for scenarios where you want to use the extra features, emotion, landmarks etc. Recongition02 and higher is designed to handle images with increased blur and partial faces. Use 01 to see if I am happy beating an Owl, 02 for making sure you are accurate identifying someone beating up an owl)

<h6>Blur Me</h6>
So now Faces are recognized onto the Blur, or latest that would be the plan. The array of information a <a href="https://dev.cognitive.azure.cn/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236">Face Rectangle</a> can return even includes a handy Blur option. The issue is this is to identify if there is Blur effects present in the image or not. 

This set of properties might be great for being a service to identify editing in Instagram images but less so for protecting my face.  

Thus, back down the Image Processing rabbit whole I went. There are third party face detection API’s but those felt like cheating since FaceApi was already doing all the word. 

An approach is to take my image, parse it to a Bitmap and to extract the location properties from the FaceRectangle to tell where to blur. Then it is a case of looping over each pixel, getting the base colour and adjusting it to create a blur effect. Apparently, it isn’t just like holding baking paper infant of something to make it less transparent.  

Big pictures have a lot of pictures, proof of concepts are not always efficient and low and behold my method took twenty seconds to run to occasionally blur correctly.  

Ain’t nobody got time for that. 

<h6>Block Me</h6>
Blurring would have looked sexy, but it wasn't the overall goal. The goal was to protect my dignity, so I moved on.  

With faces recognized and with blur ignored I just need to block my face out. Another implementation of my FaceApi/Service can worry about a prettier solution. To do this I just pass my FaceRectangles and Image (which is mapped from the stream) to my method to rush over my image and cover me up.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/BlockFaces.png" alt="Block Faces" 
    style="width: 400px; 
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;"/>

Then the image is just passed back to the BlobStorage repo and uploaded and BANG! Mr Owl Beater is no more.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/frontalOwl01And02.png" alt="Owl Blocked" 
    style="width: 400px; 
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;"/>

<h6>Drawbacks</h6>
The FaceApi is an ever-growing solution so with that it has drawbacks. With multiple recognition and detection models allowing you to switch out desired accuracy it can also end up inadvertently as a feature wall to many of the wider options. 

Saying this the accuracy of some of these extended features, like Emotion and Pose recognition can also be hit and miss.  

Luckily you can set up different calls to the service with different guidelines so if you did wanted to look my a specific face in an image you could simply use a Blur and partial friendly setup and then pass the possible faces into the Identify endpoint. 

<h6>Conclusion</h6>
The example is very straightforward barely diving into the possibilities of the FaceApi. When I think of facial recognition I think of blurring and privacy but there are hundreds of implementations. From recognizing from a video doorbell which neighbor stole your parcel or to revealing a child’s emotional response in a classroom to tell which teaching practice elicits the best response from a student.  

The choices you can now make from an image alone are much greater than before with little to no overhead, if I can block my owl exploits with a half-arsed imaginary implementation the opportunities for someone with a brain are tenfold.
