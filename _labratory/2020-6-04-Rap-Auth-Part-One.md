For a short period of my life I was a member of a middle class rap group that took beer gardens and office meeting rooms by storm with displays of lyrical genius as they redefined poetry as an art form.

The rest of the crew were signed up by bigger and better companies and as they left the talent left the group. My rap genius was forced to remain inside of my brain.

The bars we shared and the fire produced stuck with me though as I considered authentication. 

Nowadays you either need a seventy five character password to please some archaic password management system, a one time password code to a email compromised half a dozen times in a year becuase you wanted to use shiftyMcScam.com or a phone that uses a numeric selection easy to spot over the shoulder as you thumble your digits in a Weatherspoons. 

To go above and beyond finger and facial recognition were adapted. But once you link your sign-in ability to a thumb you cripple on a rusty bin you suddenly lose access. Or worse, if you faceplate drunk after one too many oranjebooms you now can’t send your Nana a birthday email because the computer says no.

With that, and an inherent interest in Microsoft Cognitive services, a grandiose idea come to mind. What is a combination of mental intelligence and specific vocals could be used for authentication? A dynamic access policy based on the speaker and their phrasing.

Thus the concept of Rap Authentication was imagined. This collection of articles will cover the journey as I try to go from being ignored by the speech to text system to being able to decide whether or not I can order a pizza based on how well I can rhyme “orange” with “door-hinge”.
