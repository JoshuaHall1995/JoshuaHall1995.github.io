<h1>Josh in a nutshell</h1>

A graduate from the prestigious University of Hull who has worked across a variety of exciting sectors: Manufacturing, Childcare and Boating. 

Josh, despite numerous character flaws and conspicuous life choices, has endured a mildly successful career.

Passions include testing, watching builds and pair programming (with a puppet of a beaver dressed as a bee).
